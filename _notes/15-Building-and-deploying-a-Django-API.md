# Building and Deploying a Django API

In the **"Building and Deploying a Django API"** project, you will develop and deploy a Social Media API using Django and Django REST Framework (DRF).

This project covers key aspects of building a robust API, including setting up the project, implementing user authentication, adding core functionalities such as posts, comments, follows, and notifications, and finally deploying the API to a production environment. By the end of this project, you will have a fully functional social media API deployed and ready for real-world use.
