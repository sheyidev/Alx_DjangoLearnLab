## Task 0
## Initial Setup and Project Configuration for a Django Blog

**Objective:** Set up a new Django project specifically for a blog, which includes configuring the environment, establishing the initial models, and preparing the base templates. This foundational task ensures all participants start with a consistent and standardized setup.

## Task Description:
Kick off the development of a comprehensive Django blog project. You’ll begin by setting up the Django environment, creating the primary Django application, and configuring the basic models necessary for a blogging platform.

**Step 1: Project Setup**

**Install Django and Start the Project:**

  - Ensure Django is installed using `pip install django.`
  - Create a new Django project named `django_blog: bash django-admin startproject django_blog`
 - Navigate into your project directory and create a new Django app called blog: bash cd django_blog python manage.py startapp blog
 - Register the new blog app by adding it to the INSTALLED_APPS list in django_blog/settings.py.
 

### Step 2: Configure the Database

#### Database Configuration:
By default, Django uses SQLite. If this is sufficient for your blog, no action is needed. However, for learning purposes, you can configure it to use PostgreSQL or another database by adjusting the `DATABASES` setting in `settings.py`.

---

### Step 3: Define Blog Models

#### Model Specifications:
Create a model `Post` in `blog/models.py` with the following fields:
- `title`: `models.CharField(max_length=200)`
- `content`: `models.TextField()`
- `published_date`: `models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)`
- `author`: `models.ForeignKey` to Django’s `User` model, with a relation to handle multiple posts by a single author.

Run the migrations to create the model in the database:

```py
python manage.py makemigrations blog
python manage.py migrate
```

---

### Step 4: Set Up Static and Template Directories

#### Static Files and Templates:
- Create directories for static files and templates within the `blog` app.

- Place the provided HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files into the appropriate directories. Ensure that Django is configured to find these files by setting `STATIC_URL` and `TEMPLATES` in `settings.py`.

---

### Step 5: Launch the Development Server

#### Initial Testing:
- Start the Django development server to ensure everything is set up correctly:

```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

- Open a browser and go to [http://127.0.0.1:8000/](http://127.0.0.1:8000/) to see the initial setup.

---

### Deliverables:

- **Project Structure**: Submit the entire Django project setup, including settings and initial migrations.
- **Code Files**: Include your `models.py` with the `Post` model defined.
- **Static and Template Files**: Provide all HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files correctly placed in their respective directories.
