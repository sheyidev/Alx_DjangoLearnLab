In the`Introduction to Building APIs with Django REST Framework` project, you will learn to create and manage RESTful APIs using Django REST Framework (DRF). 

This project is tailored for you to understand the core concepts of API development with DRF, including setting up a new Django project, creating serializers, viewsets, and implementing authentication and permissions. 

By the end of this project, you will have the foundational skills needed to build robust APIs with Django REST Framework.


## Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, you will be able to:

1. **Set Up a New Django Project with Django REST Framework:**

    - Create a new Django project and configure it to use Django REST Framework.
    -  Set up a basic environment for API development, including creating models and running migrations.

2. **Build Your First API Endpoint with Django REST Framework:**

   - Develop a simple API endpoint to retrieve data using serializers and views in DRF.
   - Understand the core components of DRF, including serializers and generic views.

3. **Implement CRUD Operations with ViewSets and Routers in Django REST Framework:**

  - Use DRFâ€™s ViewSets and Routers to simplify the implementation of CRUD operations.
 - Manage standard database operations through RESTful APIs effectively.

4. **Implement Authentication and Permissions in Django REST Framework:**

  - Secure API endpoints by implementing authentication schemes and permission settings.
  - Ensure only authorized users can access and modify data through the API.
