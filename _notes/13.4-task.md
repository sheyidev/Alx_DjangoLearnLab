**Objective:** Initiate a new Django project tailored for advanced API development with Django REST Framework, focusing on creating custom serializers that handle complex data structures and nested relationships.

### Task Description:
This task involves setting up a new Django project from scratch, installing Django REST Framework, and configuring a clean environment to develop an API that utilizes custom serializers, including handling nested objects and implementing data validation.

**Step 1: Install Django and Django REST Framework**

- Action Items:
   - Install Django and Django REST Framework using pip.
   - Create a new Django project named advanced_api_project.
   - Inside the project, create a new Django app named api.
   -
**Step 2: Configure the Project**

   - Settings Configuration:
      - Add rest_framework to INSTALLED_APPS in your project’s settings.py.
       - Ensure the project is set to use Django’s default SQLite database for simplicity, or configure another database if preferred.

**Step 3: Define Data Models**

**Model Requirements:**

- Create two models, Author and Book.
- The Author model should have the following fields:
- name: a string field to store the author’s name.
- The Book model should have the following fields:
title: a string field for the book’s title.
- publication_year: an integer field for the year the book was published.
- author: a foreign key linking to the `Author` model, establishing a one-to-many relationship from Author to Books.

**Action Items:**

  - Define these models in `api/models.py.`
  - Run migrations to create these models in the database.


**Step 4: Create Custom Serializers**
- Serializer Details:

   - Create a `BookSerializer that serializes all fields of the Book model.
   - Create an `AuthorSerializer` that includes:
   - The name field.
   - A nested BookSerializer to serialize the related books dynamically.


**Validation Requirements:**

   - Add custom validation to the BookSerializer to ensure the publication_year is not in the future.

**Step 5: Document Your Model and Serializer Setup**
- Documentation Requirements:
   - In the models.py and serializers.py, add detailed comments explaining the purpose of each model and serializer.
   - Describe how the relationship between Author and Book is handled in your serializers.

**Step 6: Implement and Test**
  - Testing Guidelines:
     - Use Django admin or the Django shell to manually test creating, retrieving, and serializing Author and Book instances to ensure your serializers work as expected.

1. Building Custom Views and Generic Views in Django REST Framework
mandatory

Objective: Learn to construct custom views and utilize generic views in Django REST Framework to handle specific use cases and streamline API development.

## Task Description:
Expand your advanced_api_project by creating and configuring custom views using Django REST Framework’s powerful generic views and mixins. This task will focus on efficiently handling CRUD operations and fine-tuning API behavior to meet specific requirements.

**Step 1: Set Up Generic Views**
- Action Items:
   - Implement a set of generic views for the Book model to handle CRUD operations. This includes:
   - A ListView for retrieving all books.
   - A DetailView for retrieving a single book by ID.
   - A CreateView for adding a new book.
   - An UpdateView for modifying an existing book.
   - A DeleteView for removing a book.

**Step 2: Define URL Patterns**
  - Routing Requirements:
     - Configure URL patterns in api/urls.py to connect the aforementioned views with specific endpoints.
     - Each view should have a unique URL path corresponding to its function (e.g., /books/ for the list view, /books/<int:pk>/ for the detail view).

**Step 3: Customize View Behavior**
- Customization Instructions:
   - Customize the CreateView and UpdateView to ensure they properly handle form submissions and data validation.
   - Integrate additional functionalities such as permission checks or filters directly into the views using DRF’s built-in features or custom methods.
   
**Step 4: Implement Permissions**
- Permissions Setup:
   - Apply Django REST Framework’s permission classes to protect API endpoints based on user roles.
   - For example, restrict CreateView, UpdateView, and DeleteView to authenticated users only, while allowing read-only access to unauthenticated users for ListView and DetailView.
   
**Step 5: Test the Views**
- Testing Guidelines:
    - Manually test each view through tools like Postman or curl to ensure they behave as expected. This includes testing the creation, retrieval, update, and deletion of Book instances.
    - Confirm that permissions are enforced correctly by attempting to access endpoints with and without proper credentials.

**Step 6: Document the View Configurations**
  - Documentation Requirements:
      - Provide clear documentation in your code (via comments) and an external README detailing how each view is configured and intended to operate.
      - Outline any custom settings or hooks used in the views to extend or modify their default behavior.

2. Implementing Filtering, Searching, and Ordering in Django REST Framework

**mandatory**

Objective: Enhance the usability and functionality of your API by implementing filtering, searching, and ordering capabilities. This task focuses on providing users with the tools to easily access and manipulate the data presented through your API.

## Task Description:
For this task within your advanced_api_project, you will add advanced query capabilities to your existing views that manage the Book model. This will allow API consumers to filter, search, and order the books based on different criteria.

**Step 1: Set Up Filtering**
 - Action Items:
    - Integrate Django REST Framework’s filtering capabilities to allow users to filter the book list by various attributes like title, author, and publication_year.
    - Use DRF’s DjangoFilterBackend or similar tools to set up comprehensive filtering options in your ListView.


**Step 2: Implement Search Functionality**
- Search Setup:
   - Enable search functionality on one or more fields of the Book model, such as title and author.
   - Configure the SearchFilter in your API to allow users to perform text searches on these fields.

**Step 3: Configure Ordering**
- Ordering Configuration:
    - Allow users to order the results by any field of the Book model, particularly title and publication_year.
    - Set up the OrderingFilter to provide front-end flexibility in sorting query results.

**Step 4: Update API Views**

**View Modifications:**
   - Adjust your BookListView to incorporate filtering, searching, and ordering functionalities.
   - Ensure that these capabilities are clearly defined and integrated into the view logic.


**Step 5: Test API Functionality**
