## Filtering, Searching, and Ordering in DRF
## Concept Overview
In this concept, we will dive deep into the context of API filtering in DRF framework. Filtering is simply the process of adding restrictions to a particular query set. For example, if you have a list of users with different roles e.g teachers, doctors, engineers etc and you would like to just get data of only teachers, you use filtering to get a queryset of only teachers.

This can look like:

`return Users.objects.filter(role=Teachers)`


## Filtering
In DRF the simplest way to filter the queryset of any view that subclasses the `GenericApiView` is to override the `..get_queryset()` method. Doing so allows you to customize the queryset returned by the view in a number of different ways .

let’s jump into some examples:

** filtering against a current user**

This is relevant only in when you would like to get data relevant to the current authenticated users. This can be done based on the value of `request.user`

```python
from myapp.models import Purchase
from myapp.serializers import PurchaseSerializer
from rest_framework import generics

class PurchaseList(generics.ListAPIView):
    serializer_class = PurchaseSerializer

    def get_queryset(self):
        """
        This view should return a list of all the purchases
        for the currently authenticated user.
        """
        user = self.request.user
        return Purchase.objects.filter(purchaser=user)
    ```


    **filtering  against url**

    This involves retricting the queryset based on some parts of the url. 
    For instance, if your URL configuration included an entry like this: 

    ```python 
    re_path('^purchases/(?P<username>.+)/$', PurchaseList.as_view()),

```
You can create a view that filters the purchase queryset based on the username from the URL:

```python

class PurchaseList(generics.ListAPIView):
    serializer_class = PurchaseSerializer

    def get_queryset(self):
        """
        This view returns a list of purchases for the user specified in the URL.
        """
        username = self.kwargs['username']
        return Purchase.objects.filter(purchaser__username=username)
```
## Filtering against query parameters

Another example of filtering involves determining the initial queryset based on query parameters in the URL.

For instance, we can override .get_queryset() to handle URLs like http://example.com/api/purchases?username=denvercoder9,

filtering the queryset only if the username parameter is present in the URL:

```python
class PurchaseList(generics.ListAPIView):
    serializer_class = PurchaseSerializer

    def get_queryset(self):
        """
        Optionally restricts the returned purchases to a specific user,
        by filtering based on the `username` query parameter in the URL.
        """
        queryset = Purchase.objects.all()
        username = self.request.query_params.get('username')
        if username is not None:
            queryset = queryset.filter(purchaser__username=username)
        return queryset


```
## Searching
DRF offers a filter called `SearchFilter` for queryset filtering based on a query parameter named ‘search’. This class will only be applied if the view has a searchfields attribute set. The searchfields attribute should be a list of names of text type fields on the model, such as `CharField` or `TextField`

For example:
```python
from rest_framework import filters

class UserListView(generics.ListAPIView):
    queryset = User.objects.all()
    serializer_class = UserSerializer
    filter_backends = [filters.SearchFilter]
    search_fields = ['username', 'email']


```
This allows the client to filter the items in the list by making queries such as:

`http://example.com/api/users?search=russell`

## ordering
This is important when it comes to controlling the order of results. and is supported by the OrderingFilter class. For example, to order users by username:

bash http://example.com/api/users?ordering=username The client may also specify reverse orderings by prefixing the field name with ‘-’, like so:

bash http://example.com/api/users?ordering=-username

Multiple orderings may also be specified:

bash http://example.com/api/users?ordering=account,username

It’s recommended that you explicitly specify which fields the API should allow in the ordering filter. You can do this by setting an ordering_fields attribute on the view, like so:

```python

class UserListView(generics.ListAPIView):
    queryset = User.objects.all()
    serializer_class = UserSerializer
    filter_backends = [filters.OrderingFilter]
    ordering_fields = ['username', 'email']
