## Objective: 

Start building a Social Media API from scratch, focusing on setting up the project environment, user authentication, and creating the initial user models.

## Task Description:
Begin by establishing the foundational elements of your Social Media API. This includes setting up the Django project, integrating Django REST Framework for API functionality, and implementing a robust user authentication system.

**Step 1: Create a New Django Project**
- Environment Setup:
   - Install Django and Django REST Framework using pip, if not already installed: bash pip install django djangorestframework
   - Create a new Django project named social_media_api: bash django-admin startproject social_media_api
   - Navigate into your project directory and create a new Django app called accounts for handling user-related functionality: bash cd social_media_api python manage.py startapp accounts
   - Add 'rest_framework' and 'accounts' to the INSTALLED_APPS in settings.py.

**Step 2: Configure User Authentication**

- User Model and Authentication:
   - Create a custom user model that extends Django’s AbstractUser, adding fields such as bio, profile_picture, and followers (a ManyToMany field referencing itself, symmetrical=False).
   - Set up Django REST Framework’s token authentication by adding 'rest_framework.authtoken' to your installed apps and running migrations to create the token model.
   - Implement views and serializers in the accounts app for user registration, login, and token retrieval.

**Step 3: Define URL Patterns**
   - Routing Configuration:
        - Configure URL patterns in accounts/urls.py to include routes for registration (/register), login (/login), and user profile management (/profile).
        - Ensure that registration and login endpoints return a token upon successful operations.
        
**Step 4: Testing and Initial Launch**
- Server Testing:
    - Start the Django development server to ensure the initial setup is configured correctly: bash python manage.py runserver
    - Use tools like Postman to test user registration and login functionalities, verifying that tokens are generated and returned correctly.

**Deliverables:**
1. **Project Setup Files:** Include all configuration files, initial migrations, and the Django project structure.
2. **Code Files:** Include models, views, and serializers for the user authentication system in the `accounts` app.

## 2. Implementing User Follows and Feed Functionality
mandatory

**Objective:** Expand the Social Media API by adding features for users to follow other users and view an aggregated feed of posts from users they follow. 

This task enhances the social aspect of the platform, mimicking key functionalities seen in popular social media networks.

**Task Description:**

In this task, you will build on your existing `social_media_api` by incorporating user relationships and a dynamic content feed. This involves managing user follow relationships and creating a feed that displays posts from followed users.

**Step 1: Update the User Model to Handle Follows**

- **Model Adjustments:**
    - Modify your custom user model to include a following field, which is a many-to-many relationship to itself, representing the users that a given user follows.
     - Make necessary migrations to update the user model: bash python manage.py makemigrations accounts python manage.py migrate

**Step 2: Create API Endpoints for Managing Follows:**

- **Follow Management Views:**
     - Develop views in the accounts app that allow users to follow and unfollow others. This might include actions like follow_user and unfollow_user, which update the following relationship.
     - Ensure proper permissions are enforced so users can only modify their own following list.

**Step 3: Implement the Feed Functionality**
- **Feed Generation:**
   - Create a view in the posts app that generates a feed based on the posts from users that the current user follows.
   - This view should return posts ordered by creation date, showing the most recent posts at the top.
   

**Step 4: Define URL Patterns for New Features**

- **Routing for Follows and Feed:**

    - Set up URL patterns in accounts/urls.py for follow management (e.g., /follow/<int:user_id>/ and /unfollow/<int:user_id>/).
    - Add a route in posts/urls.py for the feed endpoint, such as /feed/.
**
**Step 5: Test Follow and Feed Features**

- **Testing and Validation:**
   - Conduct thorough tests to ensure that the follow system works as intended and that the feed correctly displays posts from followed users.
   - Use Postman or similar tools to simulate the user experience and verify the correctness of the output.
